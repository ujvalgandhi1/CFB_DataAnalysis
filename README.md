# CFB_DataAnalysis
Common Repository around College Football Data Analysis

I have been playing a lot with Microsoft Fabric (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-fabric) recently and within that, the Spark Compute. The Spark engine within Fabric is fast (really fast) and a fun and quick way of putting together data artificats 

I decided to put together some data analysis around College Football and Fabric to work together to create some magic

The first step was to head over to https://collegefootballdata.com/ and sign up for an API Key (https://collegefootballdata.com/key). The good folks at this website do all the hard work in collecting data around College Football and providing an excellent and easy way to gather data 

I would also advise you to get an account on Postman to fire up the API calls because it will make your life much easier.
